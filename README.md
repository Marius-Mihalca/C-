This software offers two types of customer accounts, one called savings account
and the other current account. The savings account offers compound interest and withdrawals
facilities, but there are no verification facilities. However, the current account provides verification facilities
no interest. Current account holders should also maintain a minimum balance and, where appropriate

From this, derive the classes cur_acct and sav_acct to do more
requirements.
